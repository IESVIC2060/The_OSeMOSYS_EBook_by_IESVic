# The Pyomo Implementation of OSeMOSYS for British Columbia


This project was developed by the University of Victoria's [Institute for Integrated Energy Systems](https://www.uvic.ca/research/centres/iesvic/index.php) and aims at developing an energy system model for the Canadian province of British Columbia. Particularly, this study seeks to understand the economic and technical feasibilities of decarbonizing the province's building, transport and industrial sectors with electrification and power-to-gas transitions. 

This book contains the basics of the project's development with detailed explanations on energy modelling and how to use [Pyomo](https://www.pyomo.org/) for developing an [OSeMOSYS](http://www.osemosys.org/) model that meets the goals of our project. Additionaly, we hope this project will encourage other members of the energy sector, policy makers and the modelling community at large to opt for Pyomo when developing their models, as well as serve as a reference work for developping energy system models in the future.
